Getting data is always the hardest part of data science, here is a handy script that uses the OANDA Rest api and 
tpqoa to pull Forex bid/ask data from any date range, avoiding the 5000 candle limit set by the API.

The class object allows for an individual instrument or all instruements to be downloaded into a labelled dataframe. 
SQL functions are provided to convert the dataframe into an SQL db stored in the local directory. 


Happy analysis, and may you be forever profitable.
